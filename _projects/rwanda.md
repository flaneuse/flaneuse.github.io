### Background:
Rwanda is the most densely populated country in Africa, with a population of nearly 12 million people packed into an area the size of Maryland. What factors influence the growth of this burgeoning population, and how does this large population affect the development of the country?

<br>

### Solution:

I worked with colleagues to understand the drivers of fertility rates and malnutrition in Rwanda so the U.S. Agency for International Development field office could better design programs. To communicate the results of our analysis, I built a scrollytelling website in D3, Bootstrap, Javascript, HTML, and CSS highlighting key insights. The Rwanda office is currently using this analysis/website to redesign both a key family planning program and their nutrition/agriculture portfolio, as well as using the website as the basis for discussions with the Government of Rwanda.
