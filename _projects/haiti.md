### Background:
To help geographically prioritize where to invest in water and sanitation projects in Haiti, the project designers needed data on current access rates.

<br>

### Solution:
I pulled, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized household-level data on access to improved drinking water and improved sanitation.  These data were used to inform where to spend money on new sanitation projects.
