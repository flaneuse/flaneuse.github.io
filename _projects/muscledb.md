The [Hughes](http://openwetware.org/wiki/HughesLab) (UMSL) and [Esser](http://www.uky.edu/~kaesse2/lab_web_7_2007/SMBL/) (Univ. of Kentucky School of Medicine) labs are assembling a database of muscle tissue gene expression in mice.  Our purpose is to survey the diversity of transcription in skeletal muscle (with exemplar smooth and cardiac muscles for comparison), and provide a resource for the field as a whole.  

In this repository, weâ€™re developing a web-based platform to explore, visualize, and share these data build on a [Shiny dashboard](http://shiny.rstudio.com/).
