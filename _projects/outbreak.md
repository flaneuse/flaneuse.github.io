### About the project:
In response to the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), researchers worldwide have been generating and openly sharing data, publications, reagents, code, protocols, and more. Broad sharing of these resources improves the speed and efficiency of science. Unfortunately, there are no uniform standards and repositories for collecting all this information in one place.
<br/>
Outbreak.info aggregates data across scientific sources, providing tools to meet three major aims:
* Track daily developments in SARS-CoV-2 variants
* Integrate publications, preprints, clinical trials, datasets, protocols, and other resources into one searchable library of COVID-19 research
* Track trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths
