### Background:
Often, I have to do the same tasks in R, especially when it comes to data visualization. Rather than re-write the same things over and over again, I built reusable functions in R.

<br>

### Solution:
I've built out two R packages for use by myself and my colleagues: one focusing primarily on analysis of survey data and associated plotting using ggplot2 ([`llamar`](http://lauradhughes.com/llamar/)), and the other focused on mapping within R ([`geocenter`]().

<br>

These packages can be downloaded from github using the [`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) library:

`install.packages('devtools')`
`library(devtools)`
`install_github('flaneuse/llamar')`
`library(llamar)`
